# Jeopardy!

Play the classic quiz show right on Reddit! Test your knowledge across six categories with real questions sourced from the J-Archive.

## How It Works

A moderator creates a Jeopardy post from the subreddit menu. Community members open the post and play through a full game of Jeopardy — complete with the Jeopardy round, Double Jeopardy, and Final Jeopardy.

## Game Modes

- **Latest Game** — Play yesterday's actual Jeopardy episode with real categories and clues
- **On This Day** — Play a random game that originally aired on today's date in a past year

## Features

- **Authentic Jeopardy structure** — 6 categories, $200–$1000 in the Jeopardy round, $400–$2000 in Double Jeopardy, plus a Final Jeopardy wager
- **Daily Doubles** — Hidden on the board with a wager mechanic, just like the real show
- **Timed answers** — 15 seconds per clue, 30 seconds for Final Jeopardy
- **Fuzzy answer matching** — Handles typos, alternate phrasings, and partial answers
- **Sound effects** — Procedurally generated audio for ticks, correct/wrong answers, Daily Doubles, and round transitions
- **Personal stats** — Track your accuracy, streaks, best game, and performance by dollar value
- **Community stats** — See how you compare: per-question correct percentages, average answer times, and a global leaderboard
- **Leaderboard** — Top 20 players ranked by best single-game score
- **Responsive design** — Scales to any screen size, from mobile to desktop
