# Worms

The classic artillery strategy game comes to Reddit. Command a team of worms on destructible terrain, aim your weapons, and blast your opponents into oblivion.

## How It Works

A moderator creates a Worms post from the subreddit menu. Players join the lobby, each commanding a team of 3 worms with 100 HP each. The terrain is procedurally generated for every game, and players take turns moving, aiming, and firing weapons to eliminate the opposition.

## Weapons

| Weapon | Damage | Blast Radius | Special |
|--------|--------|-------------|---------|
| Bazooka | 45 | 40 | Affected by wind |
| Grenade | 40 | 35 | Bounces, 3s fuse |
| Banana Cannon | 25 | 15 | Two hitscan shots, no wind |
| Dynamite | 75 | 70 | Place at your feet, 5s fuse |
| Airstrike | 30 | 25 | 5 missiles from the sky |
