# Diplomacy

The classic board game of negotiation, alliance, and betrayal — now playable on Reddit. Command one of seven Great Powers in pre-WWI Europe and outmaneuver your opponents through pure strategy. No dice, no luck — only diplomacy.

## How It Works

A moderator creates a Diplomacy post from the subreddit menu. Up to 7 players join the lobby and choose a country. Remaining slots are filled by bots. Players issue simultaneous orders each turn, negotiate via in-game chat, and compete to control 18 supply centers.

## The Great Powers

| Country | Starting Supply Centers |
|---------|------------------------|
| Austria-Hungary | Vienna, Budapest, Trieste |
| England | London, Edinburgh, Liverpool |
| France | Paris, Marseilles, Brest |
| Germany | Berlin, Munich, Kiel |
| Italy | Rome, Naples, Venice |
| Russia | Moscow, St. Petersburg, Warsaw, Sevastopol |
| Turkey | Constantinople, Ankara, Smyrna |
