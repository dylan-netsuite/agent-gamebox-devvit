# Rush Hour

The beloved sliding puzzle game, now on Reddit. Slide cars and trucks out of the way to free the red car from a gridlocked 6x6 board.

## How It Works

A moderator creates a Rush Hour post from the subreddit menu. Community members open the post and solve sliding puzzles — drag vehicles along their axis to clear a path for the red car to reach the exit.

## Game Modes

- **Puzzle Catalog** — 40 hand-crafted puzzles across four difficulty tiers, from beginner to expert
- **Daily Puzzle** — A new puzzle every day, the same for everyone, with a community leaderboard
- **Puzzle Editor** — Design your own puzzles, validate them with the built-in solver, and share them

## Features

- **Smooth drag controls** — Vehicles follow your pointer in real time and snap to valid positions on release
- **Star ratings** — Earn up to 3 stars per puzzle based on how close you are to the optimal solution
- **Move and time tracking** — Every puzzle records your moves and completion time

- **Daily streak** — Track consecutive days played
- **All-time leaderboard** — Rankings for total puzzles solved and average speed
- **BFS-validated puzzles** — Every puzzle (including custom ones) is verified solvable with a known minimum move count
- **Sound effects** — Procedural audio for snaps, the exit whoosh, and puzzle completion
- **Progress tracking** — Your best result for each puzzle is saved and displayed on the catalog cards
